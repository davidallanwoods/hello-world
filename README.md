Hi Humans!

David here, I like TypeScript 2.0, Angular 2.0 and Node.js

I have almost 30 years commercial software development including C, C++ and Java.

I am dissillusioned with Java as it has lost its supposed 'Write Once, Run Everywhere' slogan.
You cannot run Java in a Browser any more!
I hate terse code and Java is turning that way!

I like to be able to read code without too much thinking!
I like interfaces.

Typescript 2.0 offers all the things I wanted from Java but Java failed to deliver!
Typescript 2.0 is scalable JavaScript. You could write a million lines of TypeScript and it would work.
After 100 lines of JavaScript you will introduce a bug.
