Hi Humans!

David here

I have almost 30 years commercial software development including C, C++ and Java.

I also like Kotlin, TypeScript, Angular and Node.js

Java seems to be starting to lose its supposed 'Write Once, Run Everywhere' slogan.

You cannot run Java in a Browser any more!

I dislike terse code and in some ways Java is starting to turn that way!

I like to be able to read code without too much thinking!
I like interfaces.

Kotlin offers many things I wanted from Java but Java failed to deliver!
As in the blurb from JetBrains:
You can write Android apps in any language that can compile and run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and your end users will be none the wiser. And one JVM-compatible programming language that's really caught the attention of the Android community is Kotlin, a statically typed programming language from JetBrains.12 Dec 2016

Typescript also offers things I wanted from JavaScript but JavaScript failed to deliver!
Typescript is scalable JavaScript. 

You could write thousands of lines of TypeScript and it would work.
After 100 lines of JavaScript you may introduce a bug.
